# interrogatorX

Downlod the word2vec pickle file from here: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OfWQPMLfrUJg6j0LBja_eEvwYr9gn8Z/view?usp=sharing" (Too large to upload on github) and place it in the interrogtorX/website/pickleFolder directory
OR
Download all the files listed in the interrogatorX/Models and Data/preprocessingData.ipynb notebook and run the notebook. Then open the word2vec.ipynb notebook and run it

How to run website:
1) Make sure the three pickle files are in the website/pickleFiles folder
2) Open your python terminal
3) cd to the website folder so it should be something like: <your folder where you downloaded the files>/interrogatorX/interrogtorX/website
4) Run the command: python run.py
5) The website is now open in localhost:3000 so open that in your browser
